This challenge testing everything we know from start to finish. This includes HTML elements, as well as both basic and advanced CSS. This knowledge was used to create a professional portfolio for someone to show to their employer. I thought it would be a little weird to do a real person, so I opted for a cartoon character as this does not take away from the skill displayed in the creation of the website. All of the links in the document lead to www.google.com as I do not have any created applications as it asks for in the criteria, however this can easily be changed by simply changing the links in the HTML.
